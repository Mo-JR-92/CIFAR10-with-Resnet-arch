# CIFAR100-with-Resnet-arch

## CIFAR100 Dataset:
The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images [link](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)



## Model Architecture:
we used Residual Networks(ResNet) [paper-link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) to create CNN  model and trained this model on CIFAR100 dataset.


## Conclusions:
The main idea behind this project is to have deeper understanding of ResNet Paper by Kaiming He.
